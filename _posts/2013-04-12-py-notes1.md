list comprehension   
`my_list = range(51)` \# build a list of the numbers from 0 to 50 (inclusive)   
`evens_to_50 = [i for i in range(51) if i % 2 == 0]` \# generate a list according to some logic   

List Slicing `list[start:end:stride]`   
`l = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]`  \# Should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]   
`print l[2:9:2]`                    \# Should be [9, 25, 49, 81]   
`backwards = l[::-1]`  \# Should be [100, 81, 64, 49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4, 1]   

Lambdas   
`lambda x: x % 3 == 0`  \# Should like def by_three(x): return x % 3 == 0   
`filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)`   
\# filter uses the lambda to determine what to filter, and the second argument is the list it does the filtering on.
