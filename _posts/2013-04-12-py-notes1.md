###list comprehension   
 \# build a list of the numbers from 0 to 50 (inclusive)   
`my_list = range(51)`   

 \# generate a list according to some logic   
`evens_to_50 = [i for i in range(51) if i % 2 == 0]`   
   

###List Slicing `list[start:end:stride]`   
 \# Should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]   
`l = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]`   

 \# Should be [9, 25, 49, 81]   
`print l[2:9:2]`        

 \# Should be [100, 81, 64, 49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4, 1]   
`backwards = l[::-1]`    
   

###Lambdas   
 \# Should like def by_three(x): return x % 3 == 0   
`lambda x: x % 3 == 0`   

 \# filter uses the lambda to determine what to filter,  
 \# and the second argument is the list it does the filtering on   
`filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)`
